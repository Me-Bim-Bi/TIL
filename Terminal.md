### File System Navigation

Commands to navigate your file system are very important. You will be using them all the time. You won't remember every single command that you use, but these are the ones that you should remember.

| Command                             | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pwd                                 | Lists the path to the working directory                                           |
| ls                                  | List directory contents                                                           |
| ls -a                               | List contents including hidden files (Files that begin with a dot)                |
| ls -l                               | List contents with more info including permissions (long listing)                 |
| ls -r                               | List contents reverse order                                                       |
| cd                                  | Change directory to home                                                          |
| cd [dirname]                        | Change directory to specific directory                                            |
| cd ~                                | Change to home directory                                                          |
| cd ..                               | Change to parent directory                                                        |
| cd -                                | Change to previous directory (which could be different than the parent of course) |
| find [dirtosearch] -name [filename] | Find location of a program                                                        |

Of course, you can group flags together. For example, if I want to see more info and view hidden files, I could do `ls -l -a` and even shorten it to `ls -la`.

### Opening a Folder or File

If you want to open a file or a folder in the GUI from your terminal, the command is different depending on the OS.

Mac - `open [dirname]`
Windows - `start [dirname]`
Linux - `xdg-open [dirname]`

You can open folders, files and even URLs

```bash
  open https://traversymedia.com
```
